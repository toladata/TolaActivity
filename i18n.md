### How Django discovers language preference
Django uses the LocaleMiddleware to discover language preference for individual users. The __LocaleMiddleware__ enables language selection through the request context.

- If we want to let each user specify their preferred language we need to use __LocaleMiddleware__. __LocaleMiddleware__ determines a user's language preferences through the request context. It is activated by adding it to __MIDDLEWARE__ in your settings (tola/settings/base.py) as one of the topmost classes, before __CommonMiddleware__, but after __SessionMiddleware__.
`MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    ...
    'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware',
    ...
)`

After first looking for a language prefix in the requested url, __LocaleMiddleware__ will look for the __LANGUAGE_SESSION_KEY__ in current user's session to determine language. (Failing that, it will look for a cookie, then at the Accept-Language HTTP header and finally in the global LANGUAGE_CODE setting. For further information about Django's algorithm to determine language preference see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/i18n/translation/)

- In order for a user to select a preferred language with a button, the Django documentation recommends the __LANGUAGE_SESSION_KEY__ option. In order for this to be successful, the __LANGUAGE_SESSION_KEY__ has to be set in __django.utils.translation__. Django comes with a view, `django.views.i18n.set_language()`, that sets a userâ€™s language preference and redirects to a given URL or, by default, back to the previous page. Activate this view by adding the following line to your URLconf:

`url(r'^i18n/', include('django.conf.urls.i18n'))`

(Source code: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/_modules/django/conf/urls/i18n/, https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/_modules/django/views/i18n/)

- In order to enable user to choose a language, include an html form in base.html. The Django documentation provides a sample html template code: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/i18n/translation/

### Translation
In order for strings to be translated by Django, you have to add hooks, called __translation strings__ to your templates and Python code. Django then extracts the translation strings into a message file where the translators will provide the equivalent strings in the target languages. Django looks for a __locale__ directory listed in the __LOCALE_PATH__ to create, compile and load message files with translation strings.

- Create __locale__ directory in tola project directory to save translation files. In this directory Django will create locale_code_for_each_languages/LC_MESSAGES directories for each language specified and within each a django.po file with the the translation strings.

- Specify the __LOCALE_PATHS__ in tola/settings/base.py like so:
`LOCALE_PATHS = [
    join(DJANGO_ROOT, 'locale'),
]`
This is where Django will create and look for translation files.

- In tola/settings/base.py import __ugettext_lazy__ function
`from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _`
The u prefix represents unicode strings in Python 2. In Python 3 __gettext()__ and __ugettext()__ can be used interchangeably.
The __ugettext_lazy__ function is used here to mark the language names for translation. Different from the __ugettext__ function which translate the string immediately, __ugetttext_lazy__ stores a lazy reference to the string and translates the string when it is used in context, such as rendering a template.

- Add list of languages available for selection.
`LANGUAGES = [
    ('fr', _('French')),
    ('es', _('Spanish')),
    ('ar', _('Arabic')),
    ('en', _('English')),
]`

- Make sure __USE_I18N__ is set to __True__.

### Internationalization: in template code

Django uses two template tags for string translations in templates. The __{% trans %}__ translates either a constant string or a variable content. The __{% blocktrans %}__ __{% endblocktrans %}__ tags enclose complex sentences consisting of variables and literals. In order to access these tags __{% load i18n %}__ must be places toward the top of the template.

### Internationalization: in Python code

- In views import ugettext() as `_`, since they are callables which return a response every time a request is issued. (No need to store translation as a reference like it is done on models, forms and apps. Here the code is only executed once at startup.)

- In models, forms and apps import ugettext_lazy() as `_`, because the code is exexuted at startup and the lazy version holds the reference to the translation string in case the user changes the languages.

### Creating and compiling translation files

- Before the creation of the messagefile make sure GNU gettext() is installed.[If deploying locally on MacOs, you either have to force link gettext() with `brew link gettext --force` (unlink it with `brew unlink gettext` after your translation is done) because it is not symlinked or, if using virtualenvwrapper, set a new PATH variable for your virtual environment. More information here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27220052/django-i18n-make-sure-you-have-gnu-gettext-tools/35579852]

- To create or update a messagefile after tags have been added, run `python manage.py makemessages -l fr` (to make a messagefile in French). Fill in translation strings and run `python manage.py compilemessages -l fr`.
